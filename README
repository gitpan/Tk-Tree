README for Tk::Tree
===================

This is a port of the Tix widget "TixTree" to Perl/Tk.

Tree is now part of the Tk core code.  This is a patch off of Tk800.0_02.
I haven't tested it, but it will probably work with Tk402 as well.

Please note that a Tree is not Scrolled like in Tix.  If you want it
scrolled use $w->Scrolled( qw/Tree .../ ) or $w->ScrlTree( qw/.../ )

This release includes:

    Tree.pm             The Tree class.
    DirTree.pm          The DirTree class.
    perl-tix-tree       Perl version of Tix4.1.0/demos/samples/Tree.tcl

Enjoy,
