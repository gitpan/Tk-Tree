README for Tk::Tree
===================

This is a port of the Tix widget "TixTree" to Perl/Tk.

My hope is that this will be merged in the normal Perl/Tk distribution.

This is my first foray into Perl/Tk programming, so I have certainly
got some things wrong.  I'll be happy to fix any bugs or unimplemented
features that you come across.

This release includes:

    VTree.pm            Base class for Tree
    Tree.pm             The Tree class
    TixWidget.pm        Implements tixEvent and tixGetimage
    perl-tix-tree       Perl version of Tix4.1.0/demos/samples/Tree.tcl
    perl-tix-dyntree    Perl version of Tix4.1.0/demos/samples/DynTree.tcl
    HList.patch         Required patch for HList.pm
    HList.pm.patched    Already patched version of HList.pm 2.013
    images              Some images used by the widgets. 

HList.patch
===========
This is a *required* patch for the HList.pm that comes with Tk402.003.
It is installed automatically.

Enjoy,
