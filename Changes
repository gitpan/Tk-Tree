Version 3.00401
===============

Fri Mar 20 11:45:54 1998  Chris Dean  <ctdean@cogit.com>

      * Tk/DirTree.pm: Created.

      * HList.pm.patched: Starting from HList.pm in Tk800.0_02, removed
        references to EventType.  The -indicatorcmd callback takes the
        EventType as an additional argument.

      * Tk/Tree.pm: Starting from Tree.pm in Tk800.0_02, expect
        -indicatorcmd to have an additional arg.

      * examples/perl-tix-dirtree: Created.

Version 0.05
============

Mon Jan 12 13:21:41 1998  Chris Dean  <ctdean@cogit.com>

      * Tk/Tree.pm: Version 0.05

      * Tk/VTree.pm: From Achim -- A VTree isa HList, it doesn't have
        a component that is a Scrolled HList.

      * Tk/Tree.pm: From Achim -- Since a Tree is not scrolled by
        default add the Tk::Widget::ScrlTree method.

      * README: Trees are not Scrolled by default.

      * examples/adjuster: Another example

      * examples/perl-tix-*tree: Use ScrlTree

      * Tk/Tree.pm: Mention that Trees are not Scrolled in the docs.

Version 0.04
============

Mon Dec  8 13:00:46 1997  Chris Dean  <ctdean@cogit.com>

      * Tk/Tree.pm: Version 0.04

      * Tk/VTree.pm: Added VERSION to VTree.pm to help out CPAN.pm.
        Otherwise CPAN.pm's `r' command gets confused.  (From Achim
        Bohnet <ach@mpe.mpg.de>)

      * test.pl: Check for patched HList.pm.

      * Makefile.PL: Use new HList.pm if needed.

Fri Dec  5 10:46:19 1997  Chris Dean  <ctdean@cogit.com>

      * MANIFEST: Removed folder.xpm (already in Tk402.003), and Tree.n
        (the pod info supersede it).

      * Tk/Tree.pm: Moved Tree.pod to end of Tree.pm
