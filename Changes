Revision history for Perl extension Tk::Tree.

4.72  2007-11-04 Slaven Rezic <srezic@cpan.org>
      * restored 5.005 compatibility
      * reordered this file

4.71  2007-11-03 Slaven Rezic <srezic@cpan.org>
      * synchronized with version found in Tk SVN repository:
        * Pod found in Tree.pm split into own file
        * restored original indentation (NI-S style) and
          line endings (Unix) 
        * fixed Tk::Widget bug also in Tk::DirTree
        * removed Pod::Coverage test, because it does not fit into
          classic Tk modules (e.g. Populate never needs to be
          documented in a Tk system)
        * Tree.pod now follows the Tk version, which seems to
          be more modern
        * moved examples directory one up, to prevent from installing
          into the site directory

      * Tk/DirTree.pm: Created.

      * HList.pm.patched: Starting from HList.pm in Tk800.0_02, removed
        references to EventType.  The -indicatorcmd callback takes the
        EventType as an additional argument.

      * Tk/Tree.pm: Starting from Tree.pm in Tk800.0_02, expect
        -indicatorcmd to have an additional arg.

0.05  Mon Jan 12 13:21:41 1998  Chris Dean  <ctdean@cogit.com>

      * Tk/Tree.pm: Version 0.05

      * Tk/VTree.pm: From Achim -- A VTree isa HList, it doesn't have
        a component that is a Scrolled HList.

      * Tk/Tree.pm: From Achim -- Since a Tree is not scrolled by
        default add the Tk::Widget::ScrlTree method.

      * README: Trees are not Scrolled by default.

      * examples/adjuster: Another example

      * examples/perl-tix-*tree: Use ScrlTree

      * Tk/Tree.pm: Mention that Trees are not Scrolled in the docs.

0.04  Mon Dec  8 13:00:46 1997  Chris Dean  <ctdean@cogit.com>

      * Tk/Tree.pm: Version 0.04

      * Tk/VTree.pm: Added VERSION to VTree.pm to help out CPAN.pm.
        Otherwise CPAN.pm's `r' command gets confused.  (From Achim
        Bohnet <ach@mpe.mpg.de>)

        subwidget section.

      * test.pl: Check for patched HList.pm.

      * Makefile.PL: Use new HList.pm if needed.

      Fri Dec  5 10:46:19 1997  Chris Dean  <ctdean@cogit.com>

      * MANIFEST: Removed folder.xpm (already in Tk402.003), and Tree.n
        (the pod info supersede it).

      * Tk/Tree.pm: Moved Tree.pod to end of Tree.pm

      * Tk/Tree.pod: Removed some Tix leftovers via patch
        from Achim Bohnet <ach@mpe.mpg.de>.
